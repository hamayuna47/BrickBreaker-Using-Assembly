# 🎮 Brick Breaker Game - Assembly Language  

## 📌 Project Overview  
The **Brick Breaker Game** is a **2D arcade-style game** developed in **Assembly Language**, utilizing low-level graphics programming. The player controls a paddle to bounce a ball and break bricks, progressing through levels with increasing difficulty.  

## 🎯 Features  
✅ **Classic Brick Breaker Mechanics** – Move the paddle, bounce the ball, and destroy bricks.  
✅ **Score Tracking** – Earn points for breaking bricks.  
✅ **Game Over & Win Conditions** – Lose when the ball falls; win by clearing all bricks.  
✅ **Custom Graphics & Animation** – Uses Assembly-based graphics for rendering.  
✅ **Keyboard Controls** – Move the paddle using arrow keys.  
✅ **Optimized Performance** – Runs efficiently on low-level hardware.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Assembly Language (x86 MASM / NASM / TASM)**  
- **Interrupts (BIOS & DOS) for Graphics**  
- **Keyboard Interrupts for User Input**  
- **Pixel Rendering using Low-Level Graphics**  

## 🎮 How to Play  
1. Use **left (←) and right (→) arrow keys** to move the paddle.  
2. Hit the **ball with the paddle** to bounce it back and break bricks.  
3. Keep the ball **from falling off the screen**.  
4. Clear all bricks to **win the game**!  

## 🔧 Installation Guide  
### Prerequisites  
- **DOSBox / MASM / NASM / TASM** (for running assembly programs)  
- **Windows or a DOS-compatible emulator**  

### Steps  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BrickBreaker-Game-Using-Assembly.git
   cd BrickBreaker-Game-Using-Assembly
   ```  
2. Open **DOSBox** and mount the project folder.  
3. Assemble the code using **MASM / NASM / TASM**.  
4. Run the compiled `.exe` or `.com` file.  

## 🚀 Future Enhancements  
- **Different Levels & Power-Ups**  
- **Multiple Ball Mechanics**  
- **Better Graphics & Sound Effects**
